# We have deployed a few pods in this cluster in various namespaces. Inspect them and identify the pod which is not in a Ready state. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

# Next, add a check to restart the container on the same pod if the command ls /var/www/html/file_check fails. This check should start after a delay of 10 seconds and run every 60 seconds.

# You may delete and recreate the object. Ignore the warnings from the probe.

#Create a pod called my-busybox in the dev2406 namespace using the busybox image. The container should be called secret and should sleep for 3600 seconds.

# The container should mount a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume. The secret being mounted has already been created for you and is called dotfile-secret.

# Make sure that the pod is scheduled on controlplane and no other node in the cluster.
