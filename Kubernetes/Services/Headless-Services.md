### HeadLess Services in Kubernetes
* Headless services are a type of service in Kubernetes that do not have a cluster IP.
* They are used to expose a set of pods without a load balancer or cluster IP.

* Headless services are useful for stateful applications, such as databases, where you want to access individual pods directly.
* They allow you to access the pods directly by their DNS names, which are based on the pod names.

* To create a headless service, you can set the cluster IP to "None" in the service definition.
