## Understanding difference between SideCar and Co-located Container
* both reside within the same Pod, they serve distinct roles and have different lifecycle behaviors.

### SideCar Containers
* A Sidecar container is a secondary container that runs alongside the main application container within the same Pod
* Its primary purpose is to enhance or extend the functionality of the main application without modifying its code. 
* Common use cases include logging, monitoring, proxying, and data synchronization.

* Starting with Kubernetes v1.29, sidecar containers are implemented as restartable init containers by setting restartPolicy: Always, and are placed under the initContainers field. 
* This approach ensures that sidecar containers start before and are terminated after the main application containers and continue running throughout the Pod's lifecycle.

### With v1.29:
* You can now define an initContainer with restartPolicy: Always.
* This makes it behave like a sidecar:
* Starts before main containers.
* Runs alongside them.
* Keeps running until the pod is terminated.

## Co-Located Containers
* Co-located containers refer to multiple containers running within the same Pod that collaborate to achieve a common goal. 
* That is the new term now used to distinguish what was previously referred to as a sidecar before the Kubernetes v1.29 updates. 
* Unlike sidecar containers, co-located containers often share equal responsibility in the application's functionality. They can start and stop independently and may not have a defined startup order.

 ## Sidecar vs Multi-Container Patterns in Kubernetes
```
| **Aspect**               | **Sidecar Container**                                                  | **Multi-Container Pod**                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Role**         | Enhance or extend main application functionality                      | Collaborate equally in application logic                      |
| **Startup Order**        | Starts before main container (if using `initContainers`)              | No defined startup order                                      |
| **Lifecycle**            | Runs alongside main container; can be restarted independently         | Independent lifecycle                                         |
| **Typical Use Cases**    | Logging, monitoring, proxying, data synchronization                   | Multi-process applications, tightly coupled helpers           |
| **Implementation (v1.29+)** | Defined as `initContainer` with `restartPolicy: Always`           | Defined under `containers` field                              |
