## Account Types in Kubernetes
### Kubernetes supports two types of accounts:
* User Account: Used by humans (e.g., administrators or developers).
* Service Account: Used by applications or machines (e.g., monitoring tools like Prometheus or CI/CD systems like Jenkins).

* Create role and role bindings attach it to service account
* And also attach serviceAccount to deployment for to access the resources
* Give appropiate permissions for that SA
