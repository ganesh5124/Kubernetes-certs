1. Exploring the Kubernetes Attack Surface
The four C’s of cloud-native security: cloud, clusters, containers, and code—providing a narrative that sets the stage for deeper exploration into security challenges.
2. Hardening Your Kubernetes Cluster
* In this segment, you will discover essential strategies to secure your Kubernetes clusters, including:
   * Implementing CIS Benchmarks
   * Configuring authentication and authorization
   * Managing Service Accounts
   * Utilizing TLS certificates
   * Securing the Kubernetes dashboard
   * Enforcing network policies
   * Conducting secure cluster upgrades
3. Securing the Underlying System
* Securing the host system is as important as securing Kubernetes itself. This section covers methods such as:
* Minimizing the operating system footprint
* Implementing SSH hardening and access controls
* Restricting kernel modules and open ports
* Using firewalls and Seccomp for system call restrictions
* Leveraging tools like AppArmor for additional protection

4. Reducing Vulnerabilities in Microservices
* This section outlines techniques to protect microservices, including:
* Managing Admission Controllers
* Implementing Pod Security Standards
* Utilizing policy engines such as the Open Policy Agent (OPA)
* Securing secrets and runtime sandboxes
* Applying mTLS for pod-to-pod encryption

5. Securing the Software Supply Chain
* Securing your software supply chain is critical for maintaining a robust security posture. In this module, you will learn best practices such as:
* Minimizing base image sizes
* Scanning container images for vulnerabilities
* Validating and signing deployments

6. Runtime Security
* The final section is dedicated to runtime security, focusing on behavioral analytics and threat detection. You will explore tools like Falco that help establish a defense-in-depth strategy through monitoring and activity logging.
